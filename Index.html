  <h1> I have a lot of topics that really catch my attention, but this would be one that I am very interested to talk about. As in the logo, is about the characters information of this particular game known as "Undertale".
  Undertale is, basically, an RPG game that is about a child that falls down to a place named The Underground. In that world the habitants are monsters. Most of the, hate the humans for some reasons that would be revealed in the rest of the game. Most of will try to kill you, so you have the decision to defend yourself or make friends in that world.

	<h1> These would be, in my opinion, the main and the most important characters of this game.</h1>
	<h1> Frisk: </h1>
	<img src="Images used/Frisk_Render_By_Skodwarde.png" width="135" height="121" alt=""/>
<h3> 
Frisk is the playable character and main protagonist of Undertale. After Frisk falls into the Underground, they embark on a journey to return to the surface. Frisk is the last of the eight humans to fall into the Underground after travelling to Mt. Ebott. Frisk is not the "fallen human" named at the beginning of the game. 
</h3>
<h1> Toriel: </h1>
<img src="Images used/Toriel_sprite-0.png" width="104" height="246" alt=""/> 
<h3>
	Toriel is the second major character the protagonist encounters in Undertale. She saves the protagonist from Flowey and guides them through the Ruins. She is like a kind of mother for Frisk. In fact, when you meet her, it shows you like a kind of tutorial for the game. 
</h3>
<h1> Sans: </h1>
<img src="Images used/tumblr_inline_nxj0xicorj1rsvea1_540_by_yikesdepa.png" width="131" height="179" alt=""/> 
<h3>
	Sans is the brother of Papyrus and a major character in Undertale. He first appears in the forest after the protagonist exits the Ruins. He serves as a supporting character in a Neutral and True Pacifist Route and as the final boss and heroic antagonist in a Genocide Route. He is very cool and hilarous in general, he loves taking breaks and using bad puns related to skeletons.
</h3>
<h1>
	Papyrus:
</h1>

</section>
<h3>
	Papyrus is the brother of Sans and a major character in Undertale. His main motive is to capture a human so he can become a member of the Royal Guard. At first he will try to capture you, but, he can be a very good friend. He loves the pasta and doing stuff. He hates his brother´s puns and Grillby´s food.
</h3>
<h1> Now, I will leave a little gameplay of the first part of the game to give you an idea:</h1>

  <h1>
  I really love this game, it´s gameplay is very interesting and enjoyable. Because you can make your own history with different endings. Yes, in this game you can make decision that can determine your own fate. Another thing that why I like this game is because it has A LOT OF theories which try to explain some events that it doesn´t explain you in the game. Really it has a really big amount of theories and hypotesis. And, when you hear those theories it makes you feel intrigate and pensative thinking about if that theory is true or not. 
  Whatever, this aparently simple game, it contains a lot of stuff. Really, the game can look so simple but when you play it some time, it will show you a very interesting and emotional story with a lot of funny, sad, nostalgic and very good moments. All the characters presented, are well structured and with their own personality, apparience, powers, advantages, defects and biography. It doesn´t matter if there are some characters that can be silly, surely you will love at least any of the characters. 
  My favorite character is... in fact... I dont have one favorite in specific, because all of them are really good for me. I am capable to say that I really like all the characters of the whole game. This is an image of a little part of the whole game roster: </h1>
